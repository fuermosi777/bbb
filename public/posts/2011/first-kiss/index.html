    <p>It&rsquo;s an amazing day.</p>
<p>In short, we had a fight in the afternoon and I kissed her at night. Then we kissed for several times, and then we again kissed more. In her word, it is a dramatic day. I almost have forgotten why we had the fight-something about why she didn&rsquo;t want to come to my place. What I remember now only, is the feeling that her lips was on mine, hot and eager.</p>
<p>After the fight via sms, I realized that I might was jeopardizing this invaluable relationship. Thus I went to her dorm, inviting her to dinner on my way there. Loath but approbatory, she promised that she would be come downstairs in a few minutes. After &ldquo;a few minutes&rdquo;-technically twenty minutes, I saw her and I know she was still extremely angry with me.</p>
<p>After dinner, we decided to do something to spend the Eve of Duanwu. She proposed we drink beers. I knew that she scared me a little bit. After all I haven&rsquo;t met any girl who would like to drink beers to spend a night. It means that she is either a lunatic, or was in a very big mood.</p>
<p>We went to a large market and buy some beers, domestic and external, and some other snacks. We then went to a octagonal pavilion where there is few people around. Now I would like to call it &ldquo;the holy pavilion of love&rdquo;.</p>
<p>We spent an hour taking about each other and our stories, drinking beers, and when I finished them, I could feel alcohol was doing something to my body, driving me a little more nag. I couldn&rsquo;t help enclosing her and touching her arms. I watched her spectacularly pretty eyes and suddenly, I kissed her hair.</p>
<p>After a long time looking at each other, I asked her,&ldquo;I want to kiss you. Can I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said nothing but nodded her head.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t wait but put my lips on hers quickly.</p>
<p>Then I lost my mind, thinking that the whole world had stopped rotate, the wind had stopped flow and the air had become condense. I closed my eyes and tried to feel, to touch with my lips and to fuse myself into her body.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing, really.</p>
